# USD* Token: Comprehensive Documentation

## Overview

USD* is a yield-bearing stablecoin LP (Liquidity Provider) token created by Perena that offers users the benefits of stablecoin stability with automatic yield generation. This document explains how USD* works within our platform and the key features and mechanics that users should understand.

## Core Features

### 1. Stability + Yield

USD* maintains a value closely pegged to 1 USD while simultaneously generating yield (currently ~5.2% APR) from Perena's DeFi pools. This combination offers users:

- **Capital Preservation**: The value remains stable like a traditional stablecoin
- **Passive Income**: Automatic yield generation without additional actions
- **DeFi Exposure**: Benefits of DeFi yields without complex staking mechanisms

### 2. Yield Generation Mechanics

- **Source of Yield**: The yield comes from Perena's diversified DeFi pools that generate revenue from:
  - Trading fees from decentralized exchanges
  - Liquidity provision rewards
  - Interest from lending protocols
  - Other DeFi yield strategies

- **Yield Distribution**: Yield is reflected in the slowly increasing value of USD* tokens relative to the underlying stablecoins

- **Compounding**: Returns are automatically compounded, meaning users earn yield on their previously earned yield

### 3. Backed by Stablecoins

USD* is fully backed by a basket of established stablecoins:
- USDC
- USDT
- PYUSD

This diversification helps reduce risk from any single stablecoin issuer.

## User Flows

### Holding USD* for Yield

When users hold USD* in their wallet:

1. **Automatic Yield**: They earn the current APR (~5.2%) without taking any action
2. **Yield Tracking**: The dashboard shows their current balance and estimated earnings
3. **Duration**: There is no minimum holding period - yield accrues continuously
4. **Tax Efficiency**: Yield is reflected in token value rather than as separate rewards

### Spending or Transferring USD*

When users spend or transfer USD*:

1. **Yield Calculation**: Any earned yield up to the moment of transfer is "locked in" to the token value
2. **Yield Cessation**: Once tokens are transferred, the original holder no longer earns yield on the transferred amount
3. **New Holder Benefits**: The new recipient starts earning yield on the received tokens immediately
4. **No Penalties**: There are no penalties or lockup periods for using USD*

### On-Ramping (Fiat to USD*)

Users can convert fiat currency to USD* through our platform:

1. **Deposit Methods**: Credit/debit card or bank transfer
2. **Exchange Rate**: Current market rate with a small conversion fee (1%)
3. **Yield Start**: Yield generation begins immediately after the on-ramp completes
4. **Minimum Amount**: No minimum deposit amount

### Off-Ramping (USD* to Fiat)

Users can convert USD* back to fiat currency:

1. **Withdrawal Methods**: Bank transfer to user's verified account
2. **Exchange Rate**: Current market rate with a small conversion fee (1%)
3. **Yield Calculation**: All accumulated yield is included in the withdrawal amount
4. **Processing Time**: 1-2 business days for the fiat transfer to complete

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Savings Account Alternative

Users can hold USD* as a higher-yielding alternative to traditional savings accounts:
- ~5.2% APR compared to <1% at most traditional banks
- No minimum balance requirements
- No fixed terms or lockup periods

### 2. Spending with Yield Benefits

Users can use USD* for spending while benefiting from yield during the holding period:
- Hold funds in USD* until needed for payments
- Earn yield right up until the moment of spending
- No penalties for utilizing funds when needed

### 3. Remittances with Yield

Users sending money internationally can benefit from yield during the transfer process:
- Convert to USD* before sending
- Recipient can either keep in USD* to earn yield or off-ramp to local currency
- Lower fees compared to traditional remittance services

## Security and Risk Considerations

### Security Measures

- USD* tokens are secured by Solana blockchain technology
- Smart contract security audits conducted regularly
- Multi-sig controls on protocol management

### Risk Factors

- **Yield Fluctuation**: The APR is variable and may change based on market conditions
- **Stablecoin Risk**: While diversified, underlying stablecoins carry their own risks
- **Smart Contract Risk**: As with any DeFi product, smart contract vulnerabilities exist
- **Regulatory Considerations**: Regulatory changes could impact availability
