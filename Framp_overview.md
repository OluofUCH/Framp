FRAMP OVERVIEW
Framp (short for Ramp Finance) makes it easy for users to move their crypto to fiat and fiat to
crypto via on/off ramping services.
With Framp, users can pay essential bills—like electricity, data, and internet—from their wallet,
eliminating the need for third parties or using external apps. This thus bridges digital assets with
real-world needs.
At the core of Framp lies the Framp Automated Saving mechanism. With this behavioral feature,
after every transaction (such as off-ramping or bill payment), a percentage is automatically
saved from the user's remaining balance.
Framp is committed to supercharging TradFi with Solana, making Ramping technology
seamless, and promoting crypto adoption.
